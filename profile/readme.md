## Quarterly
Broke Quarterly is the chief architecture, power house and primary body, serving as a member for [Research, Provisions, Successors, and the Member of the Broke Consortium](https://github.com/b-consortium). We work in providing solutions,
and primary legislations, with legal dealings, not limited to but backing and representing every member of the Broke Consortium.

Broke Quarterly works further to protect the interest of the consortium, with best efforts to strengthen the internal walls of consortium and represent the Broke foundation.

> To build a stronger wall, Broke the weaker one.
